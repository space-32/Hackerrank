The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN,  and . Add code to print three lines where:

The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.


code:

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
def add(a,b):
    sum=a+b
    print(sum)
    
def subtract(a,b):
    sub=a-b
    print(sub)

def multiply(a,b):
    mul=a*b
    print(mul)
    
add(a,b)
subtract(a,b)
multiply(a,b)
